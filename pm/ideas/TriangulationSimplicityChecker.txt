Conditions for the triangulation:
- must contain all polygon edges
- no  other points than the polygon points
- must contain all adges of the convex hull

Types of edges:
- edges which are currently part of the polygon are called polygon edges (PE)
- edges which are currently part of the convex hull are called convex hull edges (CE)
- all other edges are called standard edges (SE)
- caution: an edges can be a PE and a CE at the same time

Initial triangulation:
- no problem as long as the initial polygon is convex => all PE are also CE
- can easily done by specific schemes for each type of initial polygons

simplicityControl():

- choosen point: C
- generate new PEs l and r 
first decision criterion:
are the two PE of C CE? 
no -> we can start just with the surrounding triangles
yes -> it may appear, that the new edges are completly outside of the polygon

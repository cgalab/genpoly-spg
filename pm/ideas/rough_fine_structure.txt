for n points:
- start with polygon of sqrt(n) points
- do maybe n random translations
- compute Voronoi diagram of edges
- insert sqrt(n) points into each edge
- for each edge:
	- do maybe n translation of points of the edge
	- additional translation condition: each point must stay in the Voronoi region of the edge
	=> intersections with edges of other Voronoi regions are avoided

This is a list of all known (all that we know) algorithms for generating a random simple polygon.

	Author: 		O'Rourke, Virmani
	Publication: 	Generating Random Polygons
	Link: 			You can find it in literature/move_approach/
	Year: 			1991
	Approach: 		Moving vertices around
	Description:
		- Start with regular polygon
		- Assign each vertex a random velocity in a random direction
		- Move vertices in order with the corresponding velocity if it is not inflicting 
			simplicity or leaving a bounding box, otherwise assign a new random velocity
			to the vertex
		- Uses just simply brute force for checking simplicity
		- Does a specific number of moves per vertex

	Publication: 	Heuristics for the Generation of Random Polygons (Chapter 2.1)
	Link: 			We have a print
	Based on: 		(1)
	Year: 			1996
	Approach: 		Moving vertices around
	Description:
		- Start with a starshaped polygon generated from a given pointset
		- Randomly choose a vertex, generate a random translation vector,
			check simplicity of the translation and apply
		- Uses just simply brute force for checking simplicity

	Publication: 	Constructing Random Polygons
	Link: 			https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220707337_Constructing_random_polygons
	Year: 			2008
	Approach: 		Inserting new vertices
	Description:
		- Start with a random triangle (vertices a randomly choosen)
		- (n-3) choose randomly one edge of the polygon, delete it, compute the set of all points
			which can be seen from the two vertices of the deleted edge (which is basically a 
			polygon), triangulate this polygon and choose randomly a new point out of this polygon
		- Claims that all possible polygons can be reached

	Year: 			2016
	Approach: 		Attachment of small polygons onto larger polygons
	Description:
		- Start with a small polygon and attach other polygons onto it
		- It is necessary to check for simplicity for each attachment
		- No complexity is given their, but I can not believe that this is fast

	Author: 		Sadhu, N. Kumar, B. Kumar
	Publication: 	Random Polygon Generation through Convex Layers
	Link: 			https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212017313005331
	Based on: 		TODO
	Year: 			2013
	Approach: 		Randomly connecting a set of vertices
	Description:
		- Computes convex layers of a pointset
		- Connects adjacent convex layers by finding "End visible" pairs of edges in the layers
			and replacing them by connecting edges
		- Can not generate each possible polygon
		- Complexity: O(n^2)

1. Distance (to origin) distribution of vertices
	Why:
		- start polygon should not be recognizable at the end of the processing
	How:
		- Measure point density relative to distance to origin
		- Use area rings around the origin
		- Outer ring will contain the corners of the bounding box
		- Vertices of holes can maybe just be treated like the other vertices,
			otherwise we get a decrease of density in the rings the holes live in
	Expactation:
		- uniform distribution over all rings
		- no higher density in the ring the start polygon lived in
		- possibly lower density in the corner ring


2. Filling of the bounding box
	Why:
		- it should be possible to generate polygons with convex hulls that are not close
			to the bounding box
	How:
		1. Idea:
			- simply compute the mean of all vertex coordinates and take a look at the distance
				to the origin
			- advantage: really simple to compute
			- disadvantage: even if most points are in the first and the third quadrant, a few points in
				in the second and no points (and also no edges) are in the fourth quadrant, the mean
				of the coordinates could be very close to the origin
		2. Idea:
			- compute the center of gravity of the polygon and take a look at the distances to the origin
			- can potentially be done by computing the center of gravity of all triangles inside the polygon
				and then computing the area weighted sum of these centers
			- advantages: at least in cases like the above mentioned the center of gravity will diverge from
				the origin
			- disadvantages: it could be hard to find all triangles inside the polygon; maybe this measure
				also tends to the origin
		3. Idea:
			- compute the area inside the polygon and outside the polygon for each quadrant
			- could easily be done by giving each triangle a property which determines, whether it lives inside
				or outside the polygon
			- expectation: hugh differences between the quadrants should be possible
			- advantages: basically easy to determine in linear time
			- disadvantages: does not rdirectly give information concerning the convex hull; what about
				partially living in multiple quandrants?


3. Enclosure of the holes
	Why: 
		- the holes should be well enclosed by the polygon, i.e. the polygon should be very close to the holes
			(at least at some points) and should also fill some of the inconvexities of the holes
	How:
		- measure area between polygon and holes
		- therefore label triangles with outside, inside and in hole

	Expectation:
		- maybe small area compared to the area of the holes?!

	Disadvantage:
		- also includes area of polygon parts which are far away from the holes


4. Convolutedness
	


What others did:
	1. "Generating Random Polygons", J. O'Rourke
		- 1. method: pretty similar to my first method with the expectation of a uniform distribution
		- 2. method: partition the area in 8 angular sectors and count the number of edges which fell
			in each sector with the expectation of a uniform distribution
		- Suggested: It seems that random polygons should have a certain "convoluted
			ness." .". precise measure of this suggests itself: define the convolutedness of a
			polygon to be maximum link distance of a path from any point in the plane exterior
			to the polygon to infinity.

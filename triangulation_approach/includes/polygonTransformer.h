	the choosen direction which with the constraint that the movement should be
	applicable with reasonable effort. This is done iterations times.

	@param 	T 			The triangulation the polygon lives in
	@param 	iterations	The number of moves which should be tried
	@return 			The number of moves which were executed at least partially

	Note:
		- The number of really performed moves is most likely less then the number of moves
			which should be tried
		- For polygons with holes the vertex also is reandomly choosen, i.e. it can be from
			the outer polygon as well as of one of the inner polygons
